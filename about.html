            S&S Duo are an upcoming, vibrant and very talented Amapiano duo from
            Johannesburg. The duo is comprised of Speedy and SpheDaDeejay.
          </p>

          <p>
            The name Speedy dates back to his early childhood days. Growing up
            in Meadowlands Zone 11 Soweto, Speedy loved anything that had to do
            with music. He started with a computer software called “Virtual DJ”
            where he learned how to compile and mix music. As time went by, he
            figured that he needs to learn how to actually produce his own music
            because he believes without music there’s no life. Speedy wanted to
            make his own music and get it out there for people to love and
            enjoy. After moving from Meadowlands to Fleurhof, he started buying
            producing equipment bit by bit to start doing what he loves. In that
            period in his life, that’s where he became friends with Sphe who
            also has the love for music.
          </p>

          <p>
            SpheDaDeejay is a young upcoming Amapiano producer and DJ from
            Fluerhof. He fell in love with the Amapiano genre in 2019, which is
            the same year that he started producing Amapiano. Sphe grew up in
            Emndeni Soweto, where he started his career as a DJ by learning how
            to DJ using an app called “crossdj” later he was also introduced to
            “Virtual DJ” and from that he went to “Cdj’s”.
          </p>

          <p>
            Speedy and SpheDaDeejay met in 2020 and started working on some
            music together and on a later stage decided to work as a duo which
            they named themselves S&S Duo. Through learning FL Studio from
            YouTube tutorials and basic skills, they started with their first
            project.
